# AtelierulDigitalJava2021

This project contains all the problems that I resolved during the "Google Atelierul Digital", and also the final project in the package with the same name

Problem 1.Imagine the following scenario "you are the owner of a tourism website". Everytime a city is added as a new destination to your website you want to be notified. 
The cities are the "observed" subjects and you "observe" the cities. When a city is added, a message is shown to notify you.

Problem 2.Imagine you are the admin of a website and everytime a new user register you want him to restrict of give acces of some options on the site. 
Implement a project that creates a new account bassed on the type of the user.
